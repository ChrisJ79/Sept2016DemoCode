One time installations are done once, install a tool in /usr/local/bin where they remain until they are uninstalled.
- install npm
- npm install -g node, nodemon and other GLOBAL packages and tools

Each time you start a new exercise, lecture, project, etc., start in an empty directory and initialize that directory using:
- git init
- npm init
- npm install --save {modules}
  - create .gitignore (node_modules)

By keeping each project in it's own directory, you will avoid conflicts and problems with multiple server.js files, index.html files, etc.
and keep it clear what is and is not part of that application.
