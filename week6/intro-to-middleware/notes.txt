This is how we pass a parameter (a key value pair)

// refactoru.com/class?id=web101&key=value

app.use // executes for ANY request
app.get // executes only for GET requests
app.post // executes only for POST requests

// Postman
Use Postman (Chrome App) to simulate a client request and view the server response.
You can set the METHOD (GET, POST, DELETE, PUT, etc), the URL and (if appropriate) the body.
To set JSON values in the request body, use the POST method, click on Body, use raw format and 
type the JSON object in the text window (ie. {"key1":"value1", "key2":"value2"} ).  Note that
node will require strict JSON format so the keys will also need to be in quotes as strings.
