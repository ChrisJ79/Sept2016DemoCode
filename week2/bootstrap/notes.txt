Bootstrap

What is it? 
-It's a very popular CSS framework made by Twitter

-Essentially a bunch of predefined class selectors with pre defined CSS rules
-Focused on responsive and mobile-first development

Bootstrap comes with lots of components:
-Normalization
-Typography (Fonts, sizes, etc)
-Layout (Grid system)
-Forms
-Buttons

Grid system
12 column layout 
12/12 columns = 100% width
6/12 columns = 50% witdth

You NEED to have these classes for the grid system to work
1.) .container / .container-fluid
2.) .row
3.) .col-ScreenSize-columns
    Ex: .col-xs-6  (for extra small screens, it will take up 6/12 columns)

    Sizes: xs, sm, md, lg

    .col-xs-12 .col-lg-6 (can combine classes to set the look for multiple screen sizes)

    .col-xs-8 .col-xs-offset-2 (take up 75% of width and offset from the left by 2 columns)

    Row heights become the height of the TALLEST column
