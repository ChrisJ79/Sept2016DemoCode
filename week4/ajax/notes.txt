AJAX - Asynchronous Javascript and XML
  (Not really XML anymore.  Now it's JSON.)
  A way that you can make HTTP requests from your javascript running in your browswer 
  and use the responses to make the page cooler.

A "Singleton" object is a single object.  
There are never two copies of an instantiation of a singleton class.

HTTP - HyperText Transfer Protocol
    Rules to transfer hypertext data.
    HTTP verbs (all use a URL): 
        GET     - reading/retrieving data from a web server
        POST    - creating a new resource or sending data on the web server
        PUT     - replace or updating data on the web server
        PATCH   - very much like PUT, updates data
        DELETE  - removes a resource from the web server
