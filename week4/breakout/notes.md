Programming Proverbs:
**DTSTTCPW** - Do the simplest thing that could possibly work
Fancy and elegant can often end up complex and hard to understand/maintain.  
If it works, you can spend a little time simplifying it but don't go down the rabbit hole of overthinking how to refactor something that works.


**DRY** - Don't repeat yourself
If you find yourself writing the same code (javascript or html), think about creating a function or directive to do the same thing.

**YAGNI** - You ain't gonna need it 
Don't write code that you "might need" until you really need it.  
Otherwise you can end up with lots of "dead" code that is never used, but cost you development time to create.
